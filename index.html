      <p class = "about_two">When I was around 11 years old, I wanted to make games which looked like those in the Yahoo games website.
        However, those thoughts I had in me faded with time. I first got into coding when I was 14. Since then, I loved coding and chose
        paths that would make me a good coder. I had to give up coding during my +1 and +2 studies, but my passion for coding never faded.
        So I took up Computer Science as my major at University. However, things did not go as planned, and I could not still find what
        I wanted to do or how to apply my code.

      <p class = "about_four">I know, much time got wasted. There were times where I was lazy; there were times where I was motivated,
        times where I could not find ways. No matter how the rollercoaster went, I realised that anything that my mind focused on those
        times, consciously or unconsciously, must be manifested.
